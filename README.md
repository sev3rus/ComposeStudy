# This branch is used to investigate how to dismiss the cursor bubble

Changes requested:
1. Add selection to the TextFieldValue to the end of the text
2. Add focusRequester to the TextField

Unresolved Issues:
1. When the user first back presses to hide the keyboard, then if the user clicks on the text field again, the cursor bubble will still show up.
